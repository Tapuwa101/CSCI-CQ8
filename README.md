Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the given code:

Time Complexity:
We can determine this by looking at how many nested loops we have in the fuction.
The outer loop runs n times and The inner loops have constant time complexity since they iterate a fixed number of times (equal to w and y.Thus time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)
